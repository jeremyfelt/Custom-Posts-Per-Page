Custom Posts Per Page provides a settings page in your WordPress admin that allows you to specify how many posts are displayed for different views.

Description
--------------
Custom Posts Per Page allows you to specify how many posts are displayed per page depending on your current view. Once settings are changed, the *Blog pages show at most* setting in the *Reading* menu will be ignored.

Settings are available for:

* Home (Index) Page
    * As long as view is set to blog posts, not static page.
* Category Pages
* Tag Pages
* Author Pages
* Archive Pages
* Search Pages
* Default Page (*Any page not covered above.*)
* Custom Post Type archive pages
    * All Custom Post Types are detected automatically.

Each of the above settings can have a different value for the first page displayed **and** subsequent paged views.

Custom Posts Per Page makes it easy to manage exactly how your content is displayed to your readers, especially when different views have different layouts, rather than relying on the single setting in the Reading menu or having to hard code options in your custom theme.

Installation
---------------

1. Upload 'custom-posts-per-page-count.php' to your plugin directory, usually 'wp-content/plugins/', or install automatically via your WordPress admin page.
1. Active Custom Posts Per Page in your plugin menu.
1. Configure using the Posts Per Page menu under Settings in your admin page. (*See Screenshot*)

That's it! The current setting for *Blog pages show at most* under *Reading* will be used to fill in the default values. You can take over from there.

Frequently Asked Questions
----------------------------
### Should I keep using WordPress 3.2.1?

* No. I'm being nice for now, but when 3.5 comes out, I'm totally removing the last piece of code that ties this plugin to 3.2.1. Sorry. :)

### Why aren't there any FAQs?

*  Because nobody has asked a question yet.
